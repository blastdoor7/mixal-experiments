# MIXAL Experiments – Canonical Algorithms in GNU MDK

This repository contains a collection of **canonical algorithms and demos in MIXAL**, the assembly language for Knuth's MIX machine, executed using the **GNU MDK emulator**. All examples are **console-only, no GUI, no Guile, and no fluff** — purely low-level.
